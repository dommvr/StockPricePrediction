# StockPricePrediction

Project to learn basic Machine Learning in Python using TensorFlow.

# Usage
 - Download any company Stock Data. For example you can use https://www.kaggle.com/ to 
   search for Stock Data. You can also use exemplary file `TSLA.csv` that contains Tesla Stock
   Data between 2010-06-29 and 2022-03-24. 
 - Put the file inside project repository.
 - After running program input file name, start date and end date. Program will learn on these stock
   price values that are between this two dates. For getting better results I recommended using only part of data,
   for example two years data. This gives us a more accurate result.

# Results
